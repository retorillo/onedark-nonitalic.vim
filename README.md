# onedark-nonitalic.vim

[geoffharcourt/one-dark.vim](https://github.com/geoffharcourt/one-dark.vim)
is a awesome and lovely color schema.

I also desired to use non-italic version of it.

## Options 

### g:onedark_italic

Set to `0` to disable all italic styles including your overrides,
set `1` to use italic styles. By default, this value is `0`.
